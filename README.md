## Our Market Entry Wedge: **MenoSarc™**

**MenoSarc™** is AnnieGuard’s first commercial module — a novel AI risk-detection engine that identifies **hidden biological drivers of soft-tissue sarcoma progression in peri- & post-menopausal women**.  

- **SEE** – Uncover hidden drivers of late-stage sarcoma progression that health systems miss  
- **FORECAST** – Predict recurrence, progression, and high-burden events before they overwhelm patients & services  
- **DELIVER** – Provide actionable insights to NHS clinicians, payers, and health systems **without disrupting existing workflows**  
- **CHANGE** – Close equity gaps, improve survival, and reduce avoidable late-stage oncology costs  

**This is our entry point into the UK and EU market.**  
From these pilots, we’ll generate **rare disease case studies** that will extend AnnieGuard’s platform into other high-priority rare diseases.
