# AnnieGuard â€“ Bridge Round One-Pager 

## AI-Powered Rare Disease Intelligence
AnnieGuard is building the **CrowdStrike for rare disease** â€” a platform that detects aggressive biology earlier, improves survival, and reduces the crushing cost of late-stage disease.  

Our wedge is **MenoSarcâ„¢**, the first AI risk-detection engine targeting soft-tissue sarcoma in peri- & post-menopausal women. Sarcoma is one of the deadliest, most misdiagnosed cancers â€” and the NHS has a national rare disease mandate that makes it the perfect launchpad.  

---

## Technology & Defensibility
- **Provisional U.S. Patent Filed** covering our sarcoma risk detection engine.  
- **35+ proprietary algorithms** developed specifically for sarcoma biology â€” including novel detection, progression forecasting, recurrence prediction, and spoofing resistance.  
- **7-day turnaround** from secure dataset to actionable insights across genomic, clinical, and population-level data.  
- **HIPAA + GDPR + NHS DSPT aligned**, designed for frictionless deployment.  

We are not another AI scraping old literature â€” we are building a **category-defining moat**.

## Strategy: NHS Sprint â†’ U.S. Scale
- **Problem (U.S.):** The U.S. payer market is fragmented and slow. Early traction for rare disease screening is nearly impossible without years of lobbying.  
- **Solution (UK):** The NHS has a **Rare Diseases Framework (2021â€“2031)** that prioritizes earlier detection. This allows us to pilot faster and generate national-level validation.  
- **Execution:** Run a **6-month commercialization sprint in Manchester** (Janâ€“Jun 2026), deliver NHS pilots with MenoSarcâ„¢, and come back to the U.S. market with proof and case studies that no one else has.  

---

## 6-Month Sprint Goals (Janâ€“Jun 2026)
- Deliver **2â€“3 NHS pilots** with partner Trusts  
- Build a **$500K+ commercial pipeline** from pilot commitments  
- Advance **UKCA / MHRA regulatory alignment** (SaMD, Class IIa)  
- Generate **clinical case studies** proving earlier sarcoma detection  
- Prepare for a **$1.5Mâ€“2M Seed raise (mid-2026)** with validated NHS outcomes
